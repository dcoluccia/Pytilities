# Pytilities

Utilities from a (relatively) inexperienced Python user. Purpose is to have, over time, a collection of **general purpose** functions.

I do not intend to update this continuously. However, here is a list of functions/classes I plan to write in the coming months:
- [x] Convert a `numpy`, `list` or similar object to `TeX` table;
- [x] Find the nearest positive definite matrix. *Note*: this code is not original, but adapted. It may be useful to `MATLAB` users working with `numpy` and struggling with a Cholesky decomposition. That's because `MATLAB`'s `chol` accepts matrices with eigenvalues equal to 0, while `numpy`'s `linalg.cholesky` does not;
- [ ] A general enough plotting function;
- [ ] A function that compiles and opens a `TeX` file.
